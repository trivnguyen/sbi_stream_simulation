These are various parameters files to be used as input for a GalaxyPotential.

DB98Modx.Tpot (where x lies between 1 & 4) correspond to Model x from Dehnen & Binney (1998, MNRAS, 294, 429)

BT08.Tpot corresponds to Model I from Galactic Dynamics by Binney & Tremaine (second edition, Table 2.3)

PJM11_best.Tpot and PJM11_convenient.Tpot correspond to the 'best' and 'convenient' models from McMillan (2011, MNRAS, 414, 2446)

Piffl14.Tpot corresponds to the potential found by Piffl et al (2014, MNRAS, 445, 3133)

PJM16_best.Tpot is the best fitting potential (from the main models) from McMillan 2017 (MNRAS, 465, 76). The paper (and code) was originally avaiable in 2016, hence the name.

PJM17_best.Tpot is the same as PJM16_best.Tpot (see reasoning above).

The potentials in the subdirectory variants/ are also from McMillan (2017), and are the best fitting potentials from any of the alternative MCMC runs for which results are given in Table 6. I have not copied all of them so they are also called PJM17*
